 # NYPR Newsletter Signup
This is a simple form widget to subscribe users to a newsletter. Currently configured strictly for mailchimp lists.

## This is a toolkit module
This is a module designed to be used with [nypr-toolkit](https://github.com/nypublicradio/nypr-toolkit). See [that readme](https://github.com/nypublicradio/nypr-toolkit#development) for details on setting up a toolkit instance to work with modules.

## Development
This is a React app, bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which includes a testing framework and build tools.
First, clone this git repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nypublicradio/nypr-newsletter-signup.git
```
CD into the repo directory and install NPM modules
```
$ npm install
```
Make an env file. The sample file will include defaults to get you started.
```
$ cp .env.sample .env
```
Start a development server.
```
$ yarn start # or `npm start`
```
This will start a development server at http://localhost:3000. When it's running, a browser will open up at that address.
## Running Tests
* `yarn test` or `npm test`
## Deploying
Deployment is handled by circle. Commits to `master` will deploy to the demo environment (i.e. https://demo-apps.nypr.org/newsletter-signup). Tagged commits will deploy to the production environment.
